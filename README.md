# EmployeeAttritionUsingRandomForest
Objective
The goal was to predict whether an employee will leave the company using machine learning techniques.

Data Overview
Multiple CSV files were used, including employee details, survey ratings, office codes, and job role mappings. These were merged and preprocessed for modeling.

Model Development
RandomForestClassifier was trained with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. Label encoding was applied to categorical features.

Evaluation and Results
The model showed 100% accuracy on the test set and during cross-validation.

Visualizations
Plots were created to explore attrition trends across departments, job roles, and average ratings using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
